# Malaria Prediction System (Nigeria)

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts malaria cases across Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Nigeria using environmental, geographic, and health system indicators.

Built with Streamlit and trained using ensemble machine learning models including Random Forest and XGBoost.

## Project Overview

Malaria remains a major public health challenge in Nigeria, influenced by environmental conditions, healthcare reporting quality, and seasonal variations.

This project applies machine learning to:
- Predict malaria case burden at LGA level
- Support early intervention planning
- Provide data-driven insights for public health decision-making

---

## Problem Statement

Given:
- Weather conditions (rainfall, temperature, vegetation index)
- Health reporting indicators
- Seasonal patterns
- Geographic location (State, LGA)
- Intervention status

Predict expected malaria cases for a given period.
